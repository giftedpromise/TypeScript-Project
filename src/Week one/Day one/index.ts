/* 
Day 1: Introduction to TypeScript, Setup Development Environment
Goals:
Understand what TypeScript is and why it is used.
Set up the development environment for TypeScript.
Write a simple TypeScript program.

What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
It adds optional static types, classes, and interfaces, which help catch errors early and make code more robust.
TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript is transpiled into JavaScript using a compiler.
The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

Why Use TypeScript?
Improved code quality and readability: Static typing allows for better code documentation and readability.
Early error detection: TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
Enhanced development experience: Features like autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring are improved in IDEs.
Compatibility with JavaScript: TypeScript code can use existing JavaScript libraries and be gradually adopted in existing projects.
Setting Up the Development Environment
Install Node.js and npm

Download and install Node.js.
Verify the installation by running:
node -v
npm -v

Install TypeScript

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
npm install -g typescript
